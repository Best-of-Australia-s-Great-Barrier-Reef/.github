## 1. Best Time to Visit Great Barrier Reef

Those months are now a special diksha for picking the best time to visit the Great Barrier Reef. One or two months of good weather (just enough for iguanas to take their temperatures) and an amazing underwater visibility; that is why, it is a year-round destination with seasons that are equally enjoyable. I would, however, restrict it according to your weather preference. From June to October, it is summer down south, very pleasant weather, and waters have decent visibility.

Soon, after the arrival of a season, a wide array of activities come into view.

### Summer (December to February)
These hottest months give temperatures of around 26°C to 33°C (79°-91°F), ranging in pleasantness for swimming and snorkeling. But the humidity just kept on talking!

### Fall (March to May)
One awesome time to get away from crowds! Warm weather. Calm waters, distracted every now and then by a few exciting dives.

### Winter (May to August)
Warmer outside with clear oceanic water giving the beautiful contrast for visibility. Water temperature varies from 18 to 26 degrees of centigrade, or between 64 to 79 degrees Fahrenheit. Visibility is unusually great-diving and snorkeling at its best.

### Spring (September to November)
It is a calm period with calm seas surrounding the reef, thereby creating a peaceful holiday environment. Again, the visibility was breathtaking underwater-the perfect opportunity to see the reef.

If you're unsure when to go, the seasonal guides at puzutask com may help you book your travel for the best seeing of the reef.

## 2. Great Barrier Reef Snorkelling

Just snorkelling is one of the very few and simplest ways to experience the Great Barrier Reef. Some parts of the reef are much shallower than others, providing an excellent location where beginners may observe marine life before engaging in actual diving.

### Best Places to go Snorkelling:
- **Green Island:** This spot, twenty-seven kilometers away from Cairns, truly offers that first-time snorkeling charm. There's a boat station on the island that accesses this kind of green miracle house. Under the waters, the colorful coral reefs sit with tropical fishes.
- **Low Isles:** A quiet coral cay ideal for snorkeling off Port Douglas. The local reef marine life consists of brightly-colored corals, turtles, and hundreds of fish species.

Gear up before entering the waters. [Puzutask com](https://www.puzutask.com/) has a cool section for snorkeling gear that you could buy or rent nearby.

## 3. SCUBA DIVING: For the More Exhilarating Ones

Diving here has a great aura to it, and having that first experience must be considered amongst so many awesome experiences underwater. With a reef of some 2,900 separate reefs and 900 islands, infinite opportunities for exploration exist. Just a few of the famed resorts are:

- **Cod Hole:** Roughly 90 km off Cairns, Cod Hole is famous for the potato cod coming close to divers for a pat on the shoulder. These reefs exhibit high biodiversity: giant fish schools, huge clams, and bright-colored coral.
- **Ribbon Reefs:** Farther out, these deep, pristine water reefs harbor a dazzling diversity of marine life. For whoever needs to add some shimmer to the Great Barrier Reef, this is the place to dive.

## 4. Discover Scuba Diving

## 5. Glass Bottom Boat Ride

A glass bottom boat tour will provide a good view of the Great Barrier Reef undersea show whilst ensuring that your feet do not feel the water. These craft are glass-bottomed to allow panoramic views of the life below on the Great Barrier Reef.

Glass-bottom boat tours abound in every little corner of Cairns and Port Douglas, so an invitation to riotous coral formations, tropical fishes, and maybe the occasional sea turtle at the off-stage reefs is the way in! Some are even nice enough to make stopovers at some nearby islets or sandbanks for their guests to stretch their legs and soak up the views.

Keeping in mind the reviews and prices, Puzutask com ensures that you would feel completely confident to book the operator offering the best glass bottom boat tour in this region.

## 6. The Helicopter-Offering Beauty Put in the Air

If you want an apex view of the Great Barrier Reef, it has to be a helicopter ride. So view it as a landscape of vast water bodies, coral formations, and islands, your helicopter tour from Cairns would ensure a closer viewage of the well-loved Heart Reef, probably the most photographed location in the world.

Most are day trips from Cairns or Airlie Beach; hence they can be bundled with snorkeling or any activities that ultimately fulfill the reef experience. And remember to check out www.puzutask com for helicopter tours discount-so you can pair a discount with this once-in-a-lifetime experience.

## 7. Reef Islands and National Parks

Aside from the Great Barrier Reef, you have other islands and parks along the shore to play around with. Some islands and parks naturally receive more limelight than the others:

- **Whitsunday Islands:** A series of islands right in the middle of the Great Barrier Reef with Whitehaven Beach being the most famous among many beaches. There are also hiking, chilling, and reef-exploring activities on the islands.

## 8. Lizard Island

Lizard Island is an annihilated paradise with ghostly beaches and posh resorts. Snorkelers claim that the sun sets at Blue Lagoon only a few meters away from the beaches. Those who appreciate the seclusion see it as a paradise for reef explorers; if that's around where your island-hopping starts, then puzutask com has the actual resources and itineraries for you.

## 9. The Responsible Way Especially: Protecting Great Barrier Reef

An ocean-sized ecosystem so large in detail and beauty with a mass bleaching incident said to have taken place in the warm waters amid pollution controversy and counterparts of climate change would surely need some tourist policy and rightly so-a policy under sustainable tourism.

- Touch not or stand on the reef coral.
